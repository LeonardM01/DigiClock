An app that acts as a digital clock for your desktop when the PC is idle. For Windows, MacOS and Linux.

## Installation 

To install just download the release asset (or the github repo using "git clone"), decompress it (with 7zip or tar) and open the directory. While inside the folder open the terminal and type in "npm run npm-install && npm run packager-mac/windows/linux". 

After that you should see a directory called "release-builds" where you can open the app from. App works best in fullscreen mode.
